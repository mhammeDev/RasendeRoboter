## Introduction

This project is a Python school project aimed at implementing the famous game "Rasende Roboter" using Pygame. The goal is to recreate the game with its rules and incorporate AI algorithms such as A* and Minimax to enhance the gameplay experience.

## Features

- **Game Implementation**: Complete implementation of the "Rasende Roboter" game.
- **AI Algorithms**: Integration of A* algorithm for pathfinding and Minimax for decision-making.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive and visually appealing interface using Pygame.
- **Customizable Settings**: Options to adjust game settings and AI difficulty.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rasende-roboter.git
   cd RasendeRoboter
   cd game```

2. **Install dependeciencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt```

3. **Run the game**
   ```python main.py```

## Game Rules
The game "Rasende Roboter" follows these rules:

1. Objective: The goal is to navigate robots through a maze to reach a target.
2. Movement: Robots can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
3. Obstacles: The maze contains obstacles that robots must avoid.
4. Scoring: Points are awarded based on the efficiency of the robot's path.

## AI Implementation
1. A Algorithm*: Used for pathfinding to navigate the robots through the maze efficiently.
2. Minimax Algorithm: Used for decision-making to optimize the robot's movements and avoid obstacles.
